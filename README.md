## TriggerMine
Trying to remake the popular mobile game Pocket Mine 2 for PC

# Basically what the title says.
Of course I am opting for some improvements (You may call this my TODO list :D):  
remove payment and energy system  
improve the crafting system of cards and gear  
maybe give access to some kind of permanent buffs  
make the later levels easier and less frustrating  

# In case you don't know what this game is about:  
Your goal is to reach a certain depth. Your equipment is a pickaxe which breaks after a certain amount of hits,  
some gear and cards that buff your character. On the way down you will be able to mine ores so you can upgrade your pickaxe, etc. 

# Well at least that is what people will see. 
In reality this game will be about ___TRIGGERING A-boy___. Now, who is A-boy (Spoiler: A-boy is not his real name)?
A-boy is a good friend of mine (pocket ___mine___ to be exact xD), but he is easily triggered by well-made mobile games, such as _Angry Birds_, _Jetpack Joyride_, and many more. 
The game that seems to trigger him the most (unconfirmed, maybe there is an even better one) seems to be _Pocket Mine 2_. That is the reason why I'm remaking _Pocket Mine_: So I can play it on my (or his (this is actually never going to happen C:)) PC as well, and maybe add a few more _unexpected triggerevents_ to the game. 
If you have any recommendations for additional triggers (by that I mean stuff that will most likely trigger him), do not forget to hit me up on _TriggersGoHere@gmail.com_ (Note: this mail address doesn't actually exist).
